The excellent teaching style and excellent understanding of teaching topics. What I like the most about the course is how Amit Sir helps to improve visualization of code using proper diagrams and images. Also, proper sequencing of sample examples helps to revise the topic in the future. It’s good that sir gives more time on basic topics in the beginning so that the foundation is strong. Your knowledge and leadership provide us with a priceless model for our own careers. I am so happy you are part of my education. I learned to truly care about diversity and inclusion through your classes, and I hope now spread that message in a passionate but thoughtful way. You’re awesome!
Amazing skill of teaching and a very well structured course for people to start to learn to machine learning. The assignments are very good for understanding the practical side of machine learning. To all those thinking of getting in ML, this is a must-have course. Kindly continue these online sessions post COVID-19 pandemic. It's really helpful for those who cannot come to the institute due to timing issues /working out of Pune etc. but willing to learn from you all.
Thank You.
Kudos to Sunbeam and Amit Sir again, for conducting Machine Learning with Python course in such a great manner. Amit Sir teaching as always is very precise and he goes out of this schedule to answer and cover, each and every doubt of the students and the topic in the syllabus. The course was also extended by a week, so as to cover all the topics in a meticulous manner.
Thank you Amit Sir and Sunbeam once again :)
