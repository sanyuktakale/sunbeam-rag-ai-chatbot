Software Tools:
Jupyter Notebook
Git for version control
Docker for containerization (optional, depending on the participants)
Kubernetes for deployment (optional, depending on scalability needs)
Libraries and Tools:
Numpy, Pandas (for data manipulation)
NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
Hardware Requirements:
Own infrastructure
